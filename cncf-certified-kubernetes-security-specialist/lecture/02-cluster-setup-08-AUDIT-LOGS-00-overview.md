## Overview of Auditing

Auditing provides a security-relevant, chronological set of ercords documenting the sequence of actions in a cluster. <br>
The cluster adutis the activities generated by users, by applications that use the Kubernetes API, and by the control plane itself.

- what happened?
- when did it happen?
- who initiated it?
- on what did it happen?
- from where was it initiated?
- to where was it going?

### Audit Policy

Audit policy defines rules about what events should be recorded and what data they should include.

| Audit Levels      | Descriptions                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `None`            | Don't log events that match this rule.                                                                  |
| `Metadata`        | Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but no request or response body |
| `Request`         | Log event metadata and request body but not response body                                               |
| `RequestResponse` | Log event metadata, request and response bodies                                                         |
