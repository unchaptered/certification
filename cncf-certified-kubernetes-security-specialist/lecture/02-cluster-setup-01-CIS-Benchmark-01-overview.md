### Understanding the challenges

If you keep your server open to the internet, you will observe a huge spike in hacking attempts

### Monitoring is the Second Step

First step is to harden your infrastructure.

1.  Hardening
2.  Monitoring

### Hardening Guides

Depending on the technology that you use, the hardening steps would differ.

| Tools/Technology | Organization X      | Organization Y     |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| AWS              | 30 Hardening Steps  | 80 Hardening Steps |
| Linux Server     | 120 Hardening Steps | 40 Hardening Steps |
| Mac OS           | 20 Hardening Steps  | 25 Hardening Steps |

### Importance of Standarization

The Center of Insternet Security(CIS) provides a standardized set of security benchmarks to identify and refine effective security measures for specific set of tools and technologies.

### CIS =! Enough

Just by making use of CIS Benchmarks does not mean you are following all the best security practices for a system.

Many organization makes use of a combination of CIS Benchmarks + Custom Hardening Guidelines as part of the overall security.

- Such as PCI DSS, ISO27001 and so on
