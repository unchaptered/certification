### Infrastructure Requirements

Throughout the course, we will be learning about security aspects of K8s components in detail.

This means:
- We will be configuring K8s components from scratch.
- We will be launching kubeadm based cluster for practicals.
- We will be breaking things and re-building whenever required.

### Selecting a Provider

For our labs, we will be making use of following configuration:

- OS : Linux (Ubuntu 22 LTS)
- Cloud Provider : Digital Ocaen

> You can use any Cloud provider as you like

### Operating System Constraints

It's recommended to use the same OS version as that of the demo.
We have intentionally used Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support)

### Why digital ocean for our labs?

1. Reasonably priced serveres ($5/month) pay per hour
2. Good amount of credits for new user (referral) $100
3. Keep it simple approach
